## Installation
- Connect to your web server
- Create a folder named `CleanLoad`
- Upload the content of the downloaded .zip file to this folder
- In the newly created `CleanLoad` folder, follow the instructions in the `config.php` file to configure your Steam API key as well as your login credentials for the admin panel
- In the same folder, make sure the `cache`, `background` and `musics` folders have their permission set to **775** (if you are using FileZilla, right-click the folders, then click "File permissions..."
- In `CleanLoad/admin`, make sure the `submit.php` file has its permission set to **655**
- In `CleanLoad/scripts`, make sure the `FileCache.php` file has its permission set to **655**
- *Optional step*, if youâ€™re using a VPS: Change the owner of every file to `www-data:www-data`:
```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data CleanLoad/
```
- Open a web browser, go to *yourserver.com/CleanLoad*, where *yourserver.com* is the address of your web server, to begin the first launch configuration and verify that everything is correct
